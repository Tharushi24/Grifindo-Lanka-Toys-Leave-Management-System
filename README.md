# Grifindo-Lanka-Toys-Leave-Management-System
The Leave Management System is a desktop-based application for Grifindo Lanka Toys, designed to automate employee leave processes. It allows employees to apply for annual, casual, or short leaves and view their status, while admins can manage employees, define leave entitlements, approve or reject requests, and generate reports efficiently.
